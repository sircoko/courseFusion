Project Ideation:
=================
### 1. Introduction
   ### A brief introduction to your website idea. State the goals of the project.The values / benefits (tangible and intangible) this application can bring to a company/organization/end-user.

   Due to problems of both public and private transport, for transfer within the city, USB students have organized themselves into a network that allows them to take advantage of the use of private vehicles to move to/from the USB. At the moment, the process is manual; Students with private vehicles publish their route in a Whatsapp group and interested people contact them to meet at a convenient point.

   The idea of the web application would be to automate this system by providing a platform where users can register and depending on their role (driver or passenger) can perform the transfer process. The benefit of this application is evident as it would make visible the offers and demands of this service, leaving aside the process of contacting or verifying manually who are the possible drivers and/or passengers who match. In addition, it would serve to collect data on the transport needs of USB students.

### 2. Expected List of Features
   ### A brief list of features that you expect your website to support. Brief justifications for including these features.

   - Users registration on the website according to their role (driver/passenger)

     - Drivers:

       - Offer routes and define parameters: Destination, number of seats, possible stops, departure time, etc.
       - List the users requesting trips.
       - Define the rules for the trip: eating, smoking, listen to music, etc inside the vehicle.
       - Rate the passanger of the trip, so that the system penalizes those who do not follow the rules and thus guarantee a good service.
       - Remove/Cancel the offer.

     - Passengers:

       - Check the list of travel offers.
       - Book a particular route.
       - Rate the driver of the trip in such a way that the systmen penalizes those who do not follow safety rules (Violation of laws of transit, change of unconsciousness route, delayed departure, etc)
       - Remove/Cancel the trip request.


   - Desired features:

     - Use of googlemaps api to trace the route on map, so that passengers can choose the most convenient offer.
     - Use of phone GPS to know the diver/passenger's position privately once the travel group has been conformed.

### 3. Market Survey
   ### Do a survey of the Web to find about five web sites that might have similar ideas as yours. Briefly compare the features of these applications with your application idea.

   #### BLABLACAR
        Drivers place a price for passengers and the website charges a commission for the use of the platform. When a trip is booked, passengers receive recalling the booking data by email and SMS. Everyone can assing categories to their profile such as preferred music and conversation topics.

   #### AMOVENS
        It is a site very similar to BLABLACAR, which not only manteins the functionalities of that platform but also allows a couple of different methods to obtain vehicles (rent between private individuals and "free car" mode). It does not charge commission.

   #### MOBICOOP
        This platform does not charge commision to its users, it only accepts donations. The UI is quite intuitive; it allows searching according to criteria assigned to the driver. It allows you to define flexible schedules (since this service in intended to longer trips) both in time and date.

   #### COVOITURAGE
        This site mantains the same functionalities, perhaps with a design less attractive to the user. The customization of the user profile is much broader. It also has a comments/reviews system.
